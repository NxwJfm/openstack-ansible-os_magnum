    For all ocata releases prior to OpenStack-Ansible 15.1.16,
    several of the magnum requirements were not constrained.
    This resulted in the kubernetes version changing over time
    unexpectedly, rather than by intention. Most recently this
    lack of constraint causes the repo build to fail when trying
    to build the magnum venv due to incompatible requirements.

    The kubernetes version deployed with ocata is now constrained
    to version 2.0.0, matching the same version as deployed in
    all pike releases.
